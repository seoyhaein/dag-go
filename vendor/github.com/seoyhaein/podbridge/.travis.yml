# Please note that if you use a depth of 1 and have a queue of jobs, Travis CI wonâ€™t build commits that are in the queue when you push a new commit.
# Some operations on the repository, such as common automated code review scripts (e.g. Pronto for Ruby), may fail due to the limited git clone depth,
# not being able to access all the objects in the repository. Removing the depth flag, or running git fetch --unshallow might solve the issue.
